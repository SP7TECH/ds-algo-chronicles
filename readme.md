Always thought of implementing data structures from scratch i.e. knowing them what they are, how are they built and implemented. The repository consists of the following stuff:

### Data Structure

- Arrays (Questions)
- Linked List
- Doubly Linked List
- Stack
- Queues
- Trees
- Hash Tables
- Graphs
- Heaps

### Algorithms

- Recursion
- Tree Traversal
- Basic Sorts
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Dynamic Programming

### Please note!

> Data Structure here are classes and the member functions act as the methods that you get to use with them.

> Member Functions in the repository also have popular Leetcode Questions

Also the repository has been structured in a way wherein one gets to notice:

1. Data Structure itself
2. Popular Leetcode Questions on them
